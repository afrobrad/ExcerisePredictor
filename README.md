# Introduction

A 2013 study by Velloso et al, aimed to assess the effectiveness or correctness of weight lifting exercises using data collected from body sensors. 3 axis acceleration, gyroscope and magnetometer data were recorded using 4 Inertial measurement units position on the test subject's glove, arm, belt and dumbbell as shown in figure 1. 6 participants performed sets of 10 dumbbell bicep curls in 5 classes of movement. Class A was correctly executed and Classes B - E incorrectly executed. 

The goal of this project is to predict how well 20 weight lifting exercises were performed from a test/validation data set. A model will be trained and evaluated using data from the original study data.
